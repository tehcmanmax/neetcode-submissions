# Given the beginning of a linked list head, return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
# There is a cycle in a linked list if at least one node in the list can be visited again by following the next pointer.
# Internally, index determines the index of the beginning of the cycle, if it exists.
# The tail node of the list will set it's next pointer to the index-th node. If index = -1, then the tail node points to null and no cycle exists.
# Note: index is not given to you as a parameter. with O(n) time and O(1) space,

# solution: slow and fast pointer technique
