/*Replace Elements With Greatest Element On Right Side
Easy

Company Tags
You are given an array arr, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, and replace the last element with -1.

After doing so, return the array.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,4,5,3,1,2]

Output: [5,5,3,2,2,-1]
Example 2:

Input: arr = [3,3]

Output: [3,-1]
Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 10,000
1 <= arr[i] <= 100,000
*/

//loop from right to left, tracking highest number starting with -1
class Solution {
    public int[] replaceElements(int[] arr) {
        int rightMax = -1;
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] sol = new int[n];

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            sol[i] = rightMax;
            rightMax = Math.max(rightMax, arr[i]);
        }
        return sol;
    }
}
